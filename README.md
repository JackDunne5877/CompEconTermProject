# CompEconTermProject

This codebase is a term project for a computational economics course. We built a model to simulate social media interactions to better uderstand the influence it has on our political landscape. Attached to this repository is a pdf of our findings.

Abstract:
Through our study, we examine and model how human interactions can cause such
polarization in opinions and how this divide can be remedied. We examine factors that influence
human opinion and apply the modern phenomenon of social media to this framework. Our
results demonstrated the effects that factors such as influence from media, education, and
willingness to listen have on the distribution of opinions. Those with normal distribution of
opinions became more polarized after being exposed to polarizing news. In contrast, populations
that were already polarized became more centered around the median once they were exposed to
centrist views on the news. Furthermore, both of these distributions of opinions shifted to one
side of the spectrum after interacting with each other. More educated populations became
increasingly centrist and moderate after exposure to low credibility news sources and interactions
with one another compared to less educated populations. Populations that had higher willingness
to listen became moderate after exposure to moderate news sources and interaction with one
another. In contrast, populations with low willingness to listen stayed polarized even after they
had received the same treatment as the population with a higher willingness to listen. Our
findings show that human opinion and beliefs are subject to change and evolution. As such, it is
both susceptible to falsehoods as well as truths. The subject of human interactions is an
important topic.
